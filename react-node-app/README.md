# Setup

Run `npm install` under the client and server directories  
In `./config.yml`, set the media paths, and specify a working API key for TMDB API and Spotify Web API
```yaml
# Server-side configs
movies:
  path  : '/path/to/movies/directory'
  api   : 'api.themoviedb.org/3'
  key   : '<api_key>'
music:
  path  : '/path/to/music/directory'
  api   : 'api.spotify.com/v1'
  key   : '<auth_token>'
```
If you dont have keys, you can request API authentication from Spotify at https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/, and TMDB at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

## Naming conventions

Your media must appear in the path set by `config.yml`  
üé• **Movies**  
```
<movies_path>  
 - (subdirectory)?  
   - (movie_file_name <TMDB-movie-ID>) (.mp4|.mkv)
```
üéµ **Music**  
```
<music_path>  
 - (album_directory_name <Spotify-album-ID>)  
   - ((<disc_number>-)?<track_number> track_file_name) (.mp3)
```
Tracks not found on Spotify can be put in a directory titled `Unknown Album` sans disc/ track number
```
<music_path>  
 - Unknown Album  
   - (track_file_name) (.mp3)
```
## Generating metadata

Server requires `<media>.json` file data at startup. Initial json state should be empty
```json
./movies.json & ./music.json
{
  "movies": [], "music": []
}
```
Start homehost by running `yarn homehost` from the base directory. Server should open at `http://localhost:5000/`  
On the server, call `/api/generate` **once**. Wait for the async operation to finish and save  
**NOTE:** `nodemon` interrupts async data generation upon file save. Use `node server` instead for generating metadata  
By default, `5000` is the nodejs server port, `3000` is the react client port

## Routes

### Server-side

**GET** `/api/hello`  
**GET** `/api/generate`  
**GET** `/api/movies`  
**GET** `/api/movies/:id`  
**GET** `/movies/:id`  
**GET** `/api/music/`  
**GET** `/api/music/albums/:id`  
**GET** `/music/:album_id/:disc_number/:track_number`

### Client-side

`/movies` and `/music` are scheduled for v1.0 release. `/books`, `/comics`, `/podcasts`, `/tv` are TODO
